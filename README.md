### 100 days of algorithms

This repository contains notebooks with live code to accompany 100 days of algorithms challenge.

I set the challenge for myself to implement algorithm by algorithm, day by day, until the number reaches **100**.

The challenge was quite fun and rough, as well. Do not expect the implementations to be the best, nor fastest, nor nicest, nor bug-free. Do expect to see code written in haste. A code that contains the same amount of enthusiasm and love to algorithms as many it contains bugs.

Feel free to (re)use my code in any way you want.

#### Local machine

* clone the repo: `https://github.com/login106287/100-days-with-algorithms.git`

#### Notes

* The codebase was developed using `C++20 (g++20 13)`
